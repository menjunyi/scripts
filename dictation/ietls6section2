one of these is ever-present danger of disease
these killed one of third in 995, people are fearfal some similar will happend in the gar santuary , and kill many of aia olin there
indias lion are particulary vulunable because they have limited gene pool
the reason for this is interesting because all of them are sended by from a few thround lion that procive by prince that took a particular interesting them
he was very wealthy and he managed to protect them, otherwise they probably have died out completely
when you see the asia lion on india, what you sence was a enormous vitality.
